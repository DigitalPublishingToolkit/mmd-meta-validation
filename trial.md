#Illegal Art and Other Stories About Social Media

Simona Lodi 

![Cease & desist letter][image1]

[image1]: image.jpeg "Cease & desist letter" height=auto width=500px

This is the cease and desist letter that I received from WORM in
Rotterdam in 2010. That year, I included their work *Suicide Machine* in
an exhibition on ‘Cease and Desist Art’, focused precisely on the legal
troubles that can arise in art, which I organised and presented in Rome
at the Live Performers Meeting.[^1] Obviously I did not ask the artists’
permission to include them in the exhibition, as I considered it part of
the curatorial concept. 

[^1]: Letter is viewable at <http://www.toshare.it/cease&desist/C&D>\_Worm.pdf. The official website of the exhibition *Cease & Desist Art: yes this is illegal!* is found at <http://2010.liveperformersmeeting.net/artists/SimonaLodi/performances/cease-desist-art-yes-this-is-illegal/>. 

It was all, of course, a hoax. The letter, the legal firm’s website, and
all the necessary paraphernalia to lend credibility to the affair was
created by the WORM collective with the complicity of Florian Cramer. It
was a joke on the provocative joke contained in the concept of the
exhibition. All the stories I tell in this article, however, are bona
fide and true. My purpose, in fact, is to shine a spotlight on artists
whose work is a response to social media and the Web 2.0, and by doing
so explore the relationship between politics and aesthetics, and provide
a critical analysis of the artistic possibilities that centralized
social networks seek to exclude. The aim is to understand socio-cultural
transformations in the fields of art and technology in social space and
what new forms of engagement and participation have developed, providing
an opportunity to reflect on new concepts of democracy that are emerging
in our global media age. More specifically, this work focuses on three
main movements, representing three different types of response by
artists whose work challenges the Web 2.0: Illegal Art, Ironic Artivism,
and Spatial Art.

##Illegal Art

What I call Illegal Art[^2] is otherwise known as radical art. Artists
working in this field have produced artworks that target Facebook,
Twitter, and other centralized social networks – not anonymously, but
putting themselves on the front line. For some years now, it has become
popular among digital artists to focus on illegal art practices; in
particular, it has become common practice among new media artists to
attack companies that sell people’s privacy. A new form of art has
emerged that can effectively be called ‘Illegal Art’, based on the
capacity to provoke companies targeted by pirate artists, plagiarists,
hackers, and troublemakers into sending out copious cease and desist
letters.[^3] Here we will take a close look at actions that have targeted
companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google.

[^3]: A ‘cease and desist’ (C&D) is a request demanding that an individual or an organization refrain from a certain action or behavior or else face legal action. A cease and desist may take the form of an injunction or restraining order issued by a judge or government agency, in which case it has legal value, or the form of a letter sent by any individual, usually drafted by a lawyer. 

At the end of 2009, Mark Zuckerberg declared the end of privacy. The
Facebook founder said it no longer made any sense to talk about online
privacy. Social norms have changed, he claimed – just look at how
profitable companies that base their business models on social
networking and wikis have become.[^4] Almost at the same time, Facebook
blocked access of two applications to its system, *Seppukoo*[^5] and the
*Web 2.0 Suicide Machine,*[^6] both of which invited users to close their
accounts. The king of all social networks trembled before the threat of
these viral suicide campaigns. For people who feel their time is being
strangled by social networks and the mind-boggling procedures required
to cancel their accounts, the applications turned the tables on
Facebook, requiring users simply to insert their username and password
and in an instant it was done. A farewell email personalized by the user
would then be sent out to inform the user’s network of the ‘suicide’,
inviting friends to do the same and cast off their digital identity to
discover what lies beyond virtual life. Both applications were a Web 2.0
evolution of the dear old worm virus,[^7] but with the key difference that
they were activated knowingly and voluntarily by the user, and they
attacked the very system on which they were based, the social network,
and not people’s personal computers. Its logic had been turned on its
head: rather than targeting users, it was users who chose to use the
virus provided by the artists to assert their freedom, in an action of
artistic appropriation of viral marketing strategies.

[^7]: A worm is a stand-alone malware computer program that is self-replicating. It is normally spread by email as a file attachment to all or some of the email addresses saved and detected by the malicious software on the host computer.

Mark Zuckerberg’s lawyers claimed that everything users post on Facebook
is the sole and exclusive property of Facebook, as they tried to halt an
epidemic that in less than two months had led thousands of users to
close their accounts. The mass suicide risked bringing the entire Web
2.0 to its knees. While the artists used their cease and desist letters
to attract popularity, their projects made headway by exploiting
snowballing media interest in the dominant position of corporations such
as Twitter, LinkedIn and Netlog, and their abuse of such a position as
concerns the management of users’ data, which are never deleted from
their servers. Thus virtual suicide turns you into a virtual zombie, as
Gordan Savicic puts it,[^8] which is a set of photos, friends and memories
that float detached from the person to whom they belong, and who cannot
delete them. Why is there no right to oblivion on the Web 2.0? Legal
action forced Facebook out into the open, compelling the social network
to admit that the photos, videos and personal information posted by
users are the property of the corporation and not the people who provide
them, raising various issues of socio-political import, such as the
right to privacy, data retention practices and the difficulty faced in
controlling one’s own personal data. Adding a pinch of irony to it all
was the clumsiness of Facebook’s lawyers, who in demanding that *Web 2.0
Suicide Machine* cease and desist from the activity misdated the
deadline by one year prior to the date of the letter, rendering it
legally null and void. The artists’ immediate response in their defense
was to stress the fact that Facebook fails to eliminate from its systems
information that does not belong to it, going against the express wishes
of the true owners of the data, who choose to abandon Facebook. Not only
does Facebook not protect the privacy of its users, it violates the
right of people to choose how to organise their personal spheres freely
and independently.

Earning oneself a cease and desist letter has become the new frontier in
art, a symbol of the cause for the freedom to create in the Corporation
Era. Artists keen to take part go find themselves a good lawyer, rather
than a good art dealer. What is going on with the future of art? What
freedoms are these artists championing? Does it all have anything to do
with the end of the technological utopia? How has business appropriated
hacker values, exploiting open source principles, freedom and equality,
and triggering the activist response? How did we come to all this? What
was the cultural precedent? Ever since its beginnings, the overriding
importance for the internet was to keep it free, as circulating
information and the control of information is power. Having started with
a Tech Model Railroad Club,[^9] and with the logo, copyright and privacy
bandwagons are exiting from the scene step-by-step.[^10] This leads us to
ask who, exactly, is the culprit? Cue to a court room. The hearing is in
session. The lawyers are showing no mercy. The artists are in the dock.

Introducing the legal evidence: 

®™ark (pronounced ‘R-T-Mark’ or ‘artmark’)[^11] is a fake corporation
established around 1996 in the United States, which funds projects
designed to sabotage the new myths of the digital age. Its subversion
tactics involve the creation of sensational, though fake, scoops
published in the press and media. In March 1996 it launched *Digital
Hijack*[^12] by etoy, which targeted the AltaVista search engine for its
manipulation of online searches and restriction of true freedom. This
was the first strike against a corporate shell that was routing people
along pathways controlled and steered by advertisers. As the dragnet
closed, user fish were left trapped inside. The response was to hijack
the pathways. Masked as authentic hijackers, etoy crossed the line of
the law to virtually hijack the search engine’s users, who, oblivious to
the joke, found themselves in the nowhere land of ghost sites, hostage
to a bunch of IT pranksters claiming responsibility for the hijack and
calling for the release of social engineering maverick Kevin Mitnick.
The work marked a crucial turning point through its use of illegal
practices, transforming the entire activist side of Net Art into Illegal
Art. According to Franco Mattes of 0100101110101101.ORG:

[^11]: ®™ark Inc., official website: www.rtmark.com. 
[^12]: The Digital Hijack (1996),by etoy: <http://www.hijack.org>.

>	It’s not the artists who go out in search of legal troubles; nobody
	wants to be sued. If the number of lawsuits has increased it’s because
	people have got used to calling on lawyers to resolve problems, creating
	even more in the process. And it’s not just about corporations; we’ve
	been “attacked” by a publishing company, by a museum, by the Vatican –
	they’re the real pirates of the Web.[^13]

[^13]: Franco Mattes, email message to the author, 27 April 2010. 

I am not really sure whether such a definition of Illegal Art is
actually necessary, or how long it will survive in art history. For now,
though, its purpose is to identify an extremist fringe that has turned
breaking the law into an art form. The streets have become a dead
capital, and the old bunkers of power (the seats of government,
corporate headquarters) are empty simulacra.[^14] Electronic information
flows need to be tracked and traced so as to challenge those in command
today who decide, without any democratic mandate, the fates of people in
the name and on behalf of the profits that the centralization of the Web
2.0 delivers through its free-wheeling ethic. Illegal Art takes up the
politics of and voices the protests of activist movements. After
becoming hackers, the artists have become activists, lending the
rupturing force of art when it becomes a tool for social change to
anti-globalist dissent. This brings us to the concept of ‘social’. In
particular, the ‘social’ in ‘social networks’, which have no authentic
social cause, but rather, are gilded cages that are a goldmine for those
who exploit the people cooped up in them. Protests have therefore
shifted towards the public consequences of Web 2.0 which people will
carry with them throughout their lives.

In recent years – Lovink identifies 9/11 as the start of a strategy of
social terror and the defamation of the free and egalitarian internet[^15] –
the spectre of piracy has replaced the utopia of internet freedom with
the vulnerability faced by users as a consequence of unrestricted
access. In the wake of this shift, repressive regimes have clamped down
on what is seen to be a threat to the information economy. Content
industries have hired armies of lawyers to stop free exchange of any
kind outside the walled gardens of Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and the
likes, transforming the exchange-based economy permitted by the internet
into a neo-liberal marketplace. Corporations, especially the big,
multinational conglomerates, have come to be known as ‘data lords’ for
their ability to control what can be seen, heard, read and done online,
by whom, and how. The rationale underlying Illegal Art is that of the
culture jam. Culture jamming aims to disrupt consumer experience so as
to reveal the true meaning of a message that has been centralized by the
powers that be and is falsely presented as shared when in fact it is
designed to influence us as consumers. The artists’ aim is to show just
how influential big corporations are through their control of the media,
while laying bare their Achilles’ heel. A thread of posts on the nettime
mailing list[^16] discussing the cease and desist letters sent to *Seppukoo*
and *Web 2.0 Suicide Machine* led to the dusting off of an old project
by UBERMORGEN.COM, when Hans Bernard suggested spamming Facebook with
fake injunctions and restraining orders via *The Injunction Generator*[^17] –
much more effective than traditional cease and desist letters in
creating legal pressure and turning up the heat. *The Injunction
Generator* was created in 2003 in response to the legal furor over the
*Vote-Auction* website.[^18] Produced by ®™ark as a commercial website
‘bringing capitalism and democracy closer together’,[^19] *Vote-Auction* was
a media hacking performance which offered U.S. citizens the chance to
sell their presidential vote to the highest bidder during the 2000 U.S.
presidential elections of Al Gore versus George W. Bush. Restraining
orders and injunctions soon shut down the website.

By providing a critical label to collect together various types of
artwork that flout the law, the umbrella term ‘Illegal Art’ helped bring
out into the media spotlight all those artists prepared to stick their
neck out. As many battles were won, a change for the better was seen.
Since the image of the artist sits comfortably alongside the idea of
pranks and irreverent subversion, attracting legal action can be seen as
something of a trophy. This is not, of course, to underestimate the
seriousness of the consequences for the artists, or the burden of having
to pay lawyers and dedicate time to litigation. Nevertheless, for the
artists it proved a great opportunity for visibility. In interpreting
legal action as a trophy, Paolo Cirio explains that it is ‘evidence of
having raised a problem concerning freedom of speech. I see it more as
the conclusion of an action rather than its ultimate purpose’.[^20] Or as Guy
McMusker, spokesperson for Les Liens Invisible, puts it:

[^20]: Paolo Cirio, email message to the author, 28 April 2010.

>	In recent months we have been thinking a lot about what tone to give the
	supporter campaigns for works of ours that have attracted injunctions,
	cease & desist letters and prosecution. Striking a balance between
	martyrdom and the necessity of those actions being taken has always been
	of critical importance for us. The message that is very often conveyed,
	no matter what stance we take, is that there is a convenient, easy and
	safe way to express yourself and then there are things you just cannot
	do, for which we always end up becoming a living deterrent. The point is
	that an artist, especially a hacker, cannot bow to the rationale of
	power that lies behind these machinations; by going beyond it, you
	inevitably attract injunctions and legal action. Therefore we don’t
	believe so much in antagonism as a choice for making a stance; rather it
	is a necessity dictated by the desire for self-assertion, so we welcome
	turning the rationale of legal action on its head so that it becomes a
	trophy, if this can in some way incite people, rather than inhibit them
	for once, to question these so-called limits of the law.[^21]

Last in order of appearance is the work *Face to Facebook*[^22] by Paolo
Cirio and Alessandro Ludovico, who stole the user profiles of one
million Facebook users using software specially designed by them for the
purpose. A professional job, if ever there was one! Putting this
information together, they went one step further by importing and
matching the profiles on a fake dating website (www.Lovely-Faces.com).
As though reconstructing people’s histories from scratch, they invented
a virtual website that was fake, but built on real data. As people still
tend to confine what they do online to the visual space of the screen,
*Face-to-Facebook* questioned online privacy in practice, through one of
the web’s most iconic platforms. *Face-to-Facebook* was the final
project of the series *The Hacking Monopolism Trilogy*, consisting of
the works *Amazon Noir*, and *Google Will Eat Itself.*

##Ironic Artivism

In 2010 Micah White, contributing editor at *Adbusters* and an
independent activist, coined the term ‘clicktivism’. He says:
‘Clicktivism is the pollution of activism with the logic of consumerism,
marketing and computer science’,[^23] where ‘Its ineffectual marketing
campaigns spread political cynicism and draw attention away from
genuinely radical movements.’[^24] It is ‘activism degraded into
advertising’.[^25] He comments on how convenient it is to be an activist
without taking risks, seated comfortably at your desk instead of taking
part in public sit-ins and seriously battling for a cause. Similarly he
attacks the ‘slacktivist’ popularity of signing up to online petitions,
which by unquestioningly adopting the methods of modern marketing are
totally ineffectual, if not damaging to authentic activism. Exploiting
the phenomenon of clicktivism, some artists have sought to make ironic
use of such pseudo-activism to expose the absurdity of online petitions
–what Slavoj Zizek calls ‘interpassivity‘ or the illusion of doing
something.[^26] As White puts it elsewhere, ‘Clicktivism is a Trojan horse, a
tactical malware, […] What better way to cripple the revolutionary
potential of a whole generation […] privileging a data-obsessed,
metrics-oriented, technocratic approach which is closer to advertising
than resistance’.[^27]

The response of artists in this field has been to appropriate marketing
campaigns for their own ends. In the work *Tweet4Action* by Les Liens
Invisibles[^28] – a tool to ‘broaden your armchair activism horizons’[^29] – the
artists use the rhyming slogan ‘Tweet for Action, Augment your Reaction’
to encourage people to create their ‘own insurrection’ using the
communications and image strategies of an advertising campaign. They
incite slacktivists to action with the promise of becoming a leader at
no risk, using the king of the social media protest movement: Twitter.
Wonderfully tongue-in-cheek, the spoof actually gives people the tools
to create their own protest campaigns. It also parodies the renowned
U.S. website MoveOn.org, created in response to the impeachment of then
U.S. President Bill Clinton, and which has earned its founders millions
of dollars while colonizing activism with questionable technocratic
methods. In one section of the *Tweet4Action* website, all it takes is a
click to be taken through the process by a fun and friendly cartoon
figure representing the guiding image of the activist whose dream it is
to be a tousle-haired rebellious type with a placard in one hand and a
megaphone in the other. The cartoon figure is an activist-style copy of
a comforting advertisement for selling something safe –  like a protest
campaign on Twitter straight from your own smartphone. Admittedly, it
does make you want to give it a go, to start your very own personal
campaign of absolutely no interest to anyone at all, perhaps like the
majority of posts that appear on Twitter. But that might just bring you
face-to-face with the Twitter Cops,[^30] vigilantes who for years have fought
to stop people tweeting things nobody could care less about, like ‘I’m
taking a shower’ or ‘The cat’s asleep’.

A sister project to *Tweet4Action*, created by the same duo of artists[^31],
is *Repetitionr*,[^32] an online petition service. *Repetitionr*,
commissioned by the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol, enables people to
start their own petition, gathering together a million fake, though
plausible, signatures and sending them to the authorities straight from
home. It parodies the illusoriness of the belief that corporate,
centralized social networks can rally the democratic spirit that
characterized the utopias of the early life of the World Wide Web.
Instead, social networks show the failure of representative democracy,
as they have proven to be utterly ineffective from a political, social,
and economic point of view. They also mark the emptiness of
participatory democracy, as they create the illusion of taking action
and being part of a decision-making process that ultimately does not
give any cause a concrete outcome. For Les Liens Invisible, ‘In the
post-idealist era the success of a campaign is increasingly reliant on
instantaneous statistical surveys promoted to shift opinion towards
defined positions’.[^33]

According to Geoff Cox, who curated *Repetitionr*, in parodying the very
concept of democratization,

>	The project reflects the acknowledged need for new institutional forms
	that challenge existing systems of governance and representational
	structures, as a blatant expression of non-representational democracy.
	[17] The approach challenges the limits of representational democracy
	and the discourse of neo-liberalism in general, offering a means to
	rethink politics within network cultures. If this is an example of
	over-identification with real existing participatory democracy, then the
	provocation is that we need to develop far better strategies and
	techniques of organisation.[^34]

[^34]: Geoff Cox, ‘Democracy 2.0’, <http://www.anti-thesis.net/contents/texts/democracy.pdf>. Note [17] in the original text reads: ‘“Non-representational democracy” describes democracy decoupled from sovereign power, as discussed in Ned Rossiter’s *Organized Networks: Media Theory, Creative Labour, New Institutions*. Rotterdam: NAi, in association with the Institute of Network Cultures, Hogeschool van Amsterdam, 2006, 39. Rossiter also cites Paolo Virno’s *The Grammar of the Multitude*. New York: Semiotext(e), 2004’.

That provocation has been taken up by many artists who work on the
development of new networks and new forms of participation.

##Spatial Art. Alternatives in Social Media

While some artists set their sights on ‘clicktivism’, aiming their
weaponry against the useless protest network that thrives on the
internet, others focus their work on designing and promoting alternative
spaces for expression. Artists who use augmentation, information and
immersion in specific contexts, both in public and private spaces,
without authorization, aim to create interventionist actions and
collective experiences within an experimental, augmented framework, and
alternatives to social media, by occupying collective space with new
forms of collective communication. One of the results of all of this is
‘Spatial Art’,[^35] which incorporates many of the aspects involved in
developing new forms of social media. 

[^35]: Simona Lodi, ‘Spatial Art’, *Leonardo Electronic Almanac. Not Here Not There*, forthcoming, 2012.

In Spatial Art, artists play on the ambiguities in defining what reality
is –  how it is perceived, felt and detected, and how it is possible to
evert the social network into physical social space. Recently Gibson
went on the record to say, ‘Now cyberspace has everted. Turned itself
inside out. Colonized the physical’.[^36] Decentralized social networks have
enormous potential to develop offline and bring new forms of civic
engagement into collective space. *The Invisible Pavilion* is one such
example; an exhibition organized using social media through a blog. The
aim was to set up a joint protest with the artistic collective
Manifest.A.R. within the spaces of the 54th Venice Biennale. *The
Invisible Pavilion*[^37] was an uninvited, experimental experience of
squatting in the exhibition spaces of the Biennale. It itself was not a
social network, but the way the exhibition was curated can be considered
a model format for social media. The idea was not to use the augmented
space to reproduce the same curatorial scheme as the visible Biennale.
Rather, artists were asked not for one piece from a collection but for a
‘stream’ of pieces, which they unleashed on the Biennale at their
leisure through blog posts. The connections and relationships between
the streams spread to fill the Venice Biennale, in particular the
Giardini concourse, with social media, as it was natural for the artists
to dialogue spontaneously with the other artists and people sharing the
same space. *The Invisible Pavilion* project led to a new partnership
with the artistic collective Manifest.AR and their *Venice Biennale 2011
AR Intervention*. Together a format was built that stepped up the
interventionist component of the projects. The curatorial experiment
helped us understand how to make the most of augmented space to create a
new sort of network.

Other artists are also exploring the potential of new forms of social
media. Sander Veenhof’s work particularly focuses on this field, as he
himself explained in an interview with Kevin Holmes:

>	I’ve foremostly been exploring the domain of dynamic multi-user
	augmented reality, by which I mean the non-static placement of content
	into the global virtual public space: a parallel reality with a radical
	lack of any kind of boundaries. I’ve been creating tools and mechanisms
	to open up this virtual space to anyone wanting to contribute, as with
	the Cityshapes[^38] project in Dortmund, Germany. And to highlight what
	extent this new hybrid reality stretches out, I co-organized an
	uninvited AR guerrilla exhibition[^39] within the walls of the MoMA in New
	York. Taking that approach one step further, Mark Skwarek and I launched
	virtual Twitter-connected items inside the Pentagon and inside the Oval
	Office of Barack Obama, creating a public communication hotline straight
	to the president’s desk.[^40] If an iPhone were to be allowed inside the
	White House, that is.[^41]

Tamiko Thiel’s *mARp My City*[^42] is a new work in progress to create a
crowdsourced narrative for a city. *mARp* is a term coined by Thiel to
mean ‘map with Augmented Reality’. The idea is for participants to go to
their favorite sites in a city and place augments and a brief text there
using their smartphones. Once the augments have been placed, anyone can
view them at the site through their smartphones, take screenshots and
upload them onto the *mARp*. The augments are also marked on an
interactive online map enabling anyone on the internet to view
documentation of them, but to experience the augments, people have to
visit the sites for themselves. Jonathon Baldwin has instead created
‘social maps for wireless community networks’ through the project
*Tidepools.*[^43] The map system he has developed is what he calls the result
of a ‘Ushahidi’ meets ‘The Sims’ map interface for local needs and
culture, to provide and sustain low-cost internet mesh networks’.[^44] The
project highlights the importance of maps today – not just any kind of
map though, but maps that are crowdsourced and designed to drive social
change. The project is based on the implementation of a wireless local
area network and a game-inspired interface.

Another project based on mesh technology, created by the Weise7
collective, takes the shape of a book that acts as an
internet-independent wireless server. Run by a portable, custom-made
Wi-Fi device, *The Weise7 in/compatible Laboratorium Archive*[^45] is a
record of the Weise7 Studio for Labor Berlin 8, featured at transmediale
2011. This clever little object is notable both for its utility and for
the aesthetic choice of giving it book-form, considering that books were
one of the first analog archives to be digitized.

##Tales of Techno-activism and Turning Business on its Head

Reflecting on the new concepts of democracy that are emerging in our
global media age, it is interesting to note that in the lead-up to the
Occupy Wall Street protests, radical thinker Micah White called on
‘culture jammers, augmented reality game designers, live action
roleplayers, revolutionary flashmobbers, clandestine street artists and
activists from the future’ to ‘show us that what comes after clicktivism
is a people’s revolution’.[^46] That call was answered by many such creative
types. Augmented reality, for instance, was used by artists such as
Patrick Lichty, Will Pappenheimer, and many others for the Occupy Wall
Street demonstrations. It shows that new revolutionary work by artists
coming out of the centralized Web 2.0 is confronting and spreading
throughout society. 

[^46]: Micah White, ‘A Vision of Post-Clicktivist Activism’.

The appropriation of consumerism, marketing, and advertising strategies
by artists working on new forms of decentralized social media is a
response that Tatiana Bazzichelli sums up as, ‘Don’t hate the business,
become the business’[^47] – playing on the famous line ‘Don’t hate the media,
become the media’ by Jello Biafra, musician and founder of San Francisco
punk rock band Dead Kennedys. This approach to activism critically
embraces the ideology of marketing to use it against itself, attacking
it with the very same advertising tactics and market research techniques
used to sell soap, with a view to promoting social movements built on
more brilliant solutions. An example is the decentralized application
developed by Salvatore Iaconesi for activists during street
demonstrations, designed to be citizen-centric.[^48] The app is currently
only available for activist groups, encouraging drastic action for a
real social revolution. It works as a platform that captures information
from a range of social networks, such as Flickr, Instagram, FourSquare,
Facebook and Twitter, and processes it using natural language analysis
to understand what the messages are saying. The system counts the
messages evoking danger and those suggesting the situation is safe, and
‘synthesises it into an easy-to-read interface’.[^49] Users simply point
their phone in a certain direction; areas suggested to be dangerous show
up in red, safe areas in green. The system harvests the emotions of
people, the way they express themselves through natural verbal
communication, not by following a hash tag. It was tested during the UK
riots in 2011, as well as at student protests in both London and Milan,
as a real-time system for environmental and social change using digital
ethnography studies.

All these artworks demonstrate that artists are directly engaged in the
issue of what exactly is the ‘social’ in social media,[^50] using
techno-activism to usher in new forms of equality and social change.
Bearing in mind that it is intrinsic to the nature of technology that it
should fuel change above and beyond the control that we believe we have
over it, it is imperative that we ask ourselves if this really is the
sort of ‘smart society’ that we want and what the future holds in store?
We need to take a critical and consistent approach to technology so as
not to support and adopt the wrong solutions. It is in this way that it
is possible to see techno-activism accomplishing an emancipatory,
egalitarian social revolution that is decentralized and which faithfully
embodies the social uprisings and true wishes of the people, instead of
reflecting the ideology of consumerism, marketing and advertising.
